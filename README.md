# X.ING: Cross Integrative Genomics

This package implements methods for cross-feature integration of effects from multiple studies each with multivariate contexts. The latent binary association status of each statistic was modeled to capture the omics-shared and context-shared major patterns in a hierarchical Bayesian model.

## Installation

Install `X.ING` from GitHub: 

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("ylustat/X.ING")
```

Note that `X.ING` depends on the 'CCA', "RGCCA", "MASS" package.

# Development

This package is maintained by Yihao Lu (yihaolu@uchicago.edu).
