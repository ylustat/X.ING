License: X-ING (Cross-INtegrative Genomics) is proposed for cross-omics and cross-context integrative analysis of summary-level data. 
    X-ING takes as input the statistic matrices from multiple omics studies, each with multivariate contexts. It models the latent binary association status of each statistic, and captures the omics-shared and context-shared major patterns in a hierarchical Bayesian model. 
    Via the modeling of latent binary status, X-ING enables the cross-feature integration of effects.
